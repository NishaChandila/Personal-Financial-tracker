## Data Structure 

The dataset, based on User’s bank statements from August and September 2019, includes key columns to analyze financial activity:

- **Date**: Transaction date, allowing for trend analysis over time.
- **Day**: Day of the week for each transaction, useful for spotting spending patterns by day.
- **Category**: Type of transaction (e.g., shopping, groceries), showing where funds are allocated.
- **Debit Amount**: Amount spent per transaction, providing total expenses.
- **Credit Amount**: Income or credited amounts, capturing sources of cash flow.
- **Closing Balance**: Account balance after each transaction, showing fund changes over time.
- **Type**: Classifies each transaction as a debit (expense) or credit (income) for easy income-expense tracking.

These columns enable a thorough view of income, expenses, and savings trends for better financial insight.
